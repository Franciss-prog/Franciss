# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website! It’s a simple webpage that shows who I am, what I do, and how to contact me.

## What’s Inside?

- **My Info**: You’ll see my name, job title, and the type of work I focus on.
- **Easy Navigation**: Links to Home, About, Portfolio, and Contacts.
- **Looks Good Everywhere**: The site works on phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Dark & Light Mode**: Switches themes based on your preference.

## How It’s Made

This website is built using:

- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Using Tailwind CSS to make it look nice and responsive.  
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements like buttons and menus.
- **Icons & Fonts**: Beautiful icons and fonts to make it stylish.

## How to See It

1. **Download the files**: Click the green "Code" button above and download the ZIP file.
2. **Open the file**: Double-click the `index.html` file. It will open in your web browser.

That’s it! You can now see the website.

## What’s Next?

In the future, I plan to:

- Add more detailed pages for About, Portfolio, and Contact.
- Make the website more interactive with cool animations.
- Add a form to allow visitors to send me messages directly.
